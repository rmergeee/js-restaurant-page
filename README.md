## ðŸŽ¨ Design Inspiration

**Original Design**: [Restaurant Landing Page](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1077384985779045508) from Figma Community

**My Implementation**: Instead of a static landing page, I created a dynamic single-page application where content changes based on navigation buttons (Home, Menu, Contact). All content is generated dynamically with JavaScript modules.
